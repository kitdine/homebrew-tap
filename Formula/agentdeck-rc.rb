  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Project-attribution wrappers are optional and only act when a provider
      routes through a declared Headroom wrapper. With no eligibility marker,
      wrappers invoke the real client without starting AgentDeck. When the
      marker exists, each invocation starts one AgentDeck process and performs
      one read-only database access. On the measured Intel macOS 26.6 host,
      marker-present paths added roughly 0.1-0.2 seconds per invocation; this is
      an environment-specific order of magnitude, not a performance guarantee.
      To use this, configure every shell you use with:
        agentdeck shell setup

      To undo it later:
        agentdeck shell remove

      Command completion is already installed and needs no further action.
      Skipping shell setup leaves shell-based project attribution disabled and
      does not affect normal AgentDeck use.
