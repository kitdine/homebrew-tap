  # Exactly one installation may own the global `agentdeck` command, and the two
  # halves of that exclusion are declared differently because Homebrew supports
  # only one of them as a stanza: `Cask::DSL::ConflictsWith::VALID_KEYS` is
  # `[:cask]`, and any other key makes the whole cask unloadable rather than
  # merely inert. The other cask channel is therefore declared here, and the
  # CLI-only formulae are refused by the preflight below, which names the
  # migration instead of failing on a link collision the user cannot read.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The app and the `agentdeck` command come from one installation. If the
    CLI-only formula is already installed, migrate rather than installing both:
      brew uninstall agentdeck
      brew install --cask agentdeck-app
    Your AgentDeck state in ~/.agentdeck is untouched by either direction of
    that migration, and uninstalling this cask leaves it in place.

    Project-attribution wrappers are optional and only act when a provider
    routes through a declared Headroom wrapper. To use them, configure every
    shell you use with:
      agentdeck shell setup

    To undo it later:
      agentdeck shell remove

    Command completion is already installed and needs no further action.

  # Deliberately absent from this list: ~/.agentdeck. It holds the database,
  # the machine-bound credential key, and the operation journal, none of which
  # an app uninstall may remove.
